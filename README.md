### 👋 About

I’m a full-stack software engineer focused on building and operating production-grade web systems. I work across frontend, backend, databases, and cloud infrastructure, with an emphasis on clean architecture, scalability, and long-term maintainability.

I’ve shipped real products under real constraints—from early MVPs with loose requirements to multi-tenant SaaS platforms with active users and revenue. I’m comfortable taking ownership end-to-end: turning high-level goals into working software, making product trade-offs, and ensuring systems run reliably in production.

I primarily work full-time on product teams and enjoy environments that value autonomy, clear communication, and shipping meaningful software.
